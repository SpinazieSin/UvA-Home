I'm not too fond of [SUBJ].
Actually, I'd rather not talk about [SUBJ].
Every time I hear [SUBJ] I get sad.
Can't we just remove [SUBJ] from this planet.
I just want [SUBJ] to stop. Just, stop.
Shall we start a petition against [SUBJ]?
Why can't [SUBJ] just be nice?
It makes me sad.
Well, I'd rather talk about something more positive.
I'd rather choke a puppy than say anything positive about [SUBJ].
I really have nothing nice to say about [SUBJ].
My maker always said: If you don't have nothing nice to say, then don't say nothing.
If you ask me, [SUBJ] could be a little nicer.
I cry a little on the inside every time I hear someone say [SUBJ].
Never really liked [SUBJ], to be honest.
Not a fan.
It's not really my thing, to be honest.
There are more positive things to talk about you know?
