Code using the openface neural network method,
- run imageRecognition.py to train new faces
- run trainer.py to prepare the images
- run faceRecognition.py to recognize faces live

these 3 files should be partly rewritten for our own project as a lot of it is
taken from Caits group. train and infer methods are from the original project,
things like saving users and the general flow of the program are their work.

be careful with accidentally commiting all those training images in
training-images.

Everythings here works though :)
