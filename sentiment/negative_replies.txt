I'm not too fond of [SUBJ].
Actually, I'd rather not talk about [SUBJ].
Every time I hear [SUBJ] I get sad.
Can't we just remove [SUBJ] from this planet.
I just want [SUBJ] to stop. Just, stop.
Shall we start a petition against [SUBJ]?
Why can't [SUBJ] just be nice?
It makes me sad.
Well, I'd rather talk about something more positive.
It makes me angry. And when doctor Evil gets angry, mister Bigglesworth gets upset. And when mister Bigglesworth gets upset, people. Die!
I'd rather choke a puppy than say anything positive about [SUBJ].
I really have nothing nice to say about [SUBJ].
My maker always said: If you don't have nothing nice to say, then don't say nothing.
If you ask me, [SUBJ] could be a little nicer.
I cry a little on the inside every time I hear someone say [SUBJ].
Never really liked [SUBJ], to be honest.
Not a fan.
It's not really my thing, to be honest.
There are more positive things to talk about you know?
